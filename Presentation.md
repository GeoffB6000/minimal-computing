## 0) underpinnings
1. everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is connected.
2. technology is more than products. It is a way of thinking. The stories we tell are technology. Music is technology.

## 1) from computing to minimal computing
in the beginning, all computing was minimal.

### the first computers

according to evidence found at Border Cave, South Africa, humans have been representing numbers since at least 44,000 BCE.

## 2) theory and implications
what is 'minimal' and what does it do for us?

[Jentery Sayers - "Minimal Definitions"](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/)
'minimal' means a lot of different things.

## 3) current projects and possibilities
who is going minimal and why?
