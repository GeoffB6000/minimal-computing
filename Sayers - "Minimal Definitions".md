- definitions of minimal computing "engage various histories of technology at the intersection of aesthetics and politics"

##minimal design
- "minimal computing immediately suggests minimal design" - Ipod aesthetic, the "fetishization of simplicity." What are the implications if "minimal design?" It takes an immense amount of behind the scenes work to polish something to a design that appears minimal or simplistic - the outward appearance of simplicity masks resource usages which we may not call minimal.
- "To remove excess components or use only essential elements is to define, often implicitly, what and for whom 'excess' and 'essential' mean in the first place."
- "minimalist aesethetics may all too easily afford an impression that everything has been polished or refined from the start"

- relationships between content and media. Is there such a thing as "pure content?" Everthing written online is a collaboration between writing and programming. "programming is a service that supports writing, or writing is a service with programming at its source." These things are entangled. How do we address these entanglements?

"we might consider what we marginalize, reify, or appropriate through minimal design techniques and minimalist aesthetics, in addition to how we define 'we' in relation to necessity and simplicity"
"what's the link between simplicity and trust? Who or what does simplicity ignore?"

- what do we need / what don't we need?

##minimal use
- "a minimal approach reduces the need for not only substantial storage and processing power but also a reliance on middleware, databases, peripherals, and substantial pieces of hardware. Such reduction should increase access while decreasing technology's environmental effects"
- mainframes, supercomputing, and PCs vs. "distributed computing" via Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. "Big data no longer requires big computers"
politics of the Internet of Things - mass networked surveillance via technology (smartphones, Amazon Echo, search preferences, targeted advertising), cloud computing, the use of algorithms in decision-making. "As hardware gets smaller, networks grow."
- "as we need to use less tech to build durable intelligent systems with more influence, we also need to ask how agency, accountability, and responsiblility are changing"
- "if technology is out of our way or rendered invisible with an IoT... then it accrues even more authority as an agent or participant"
- if minimal computing emphasizes the relationships between the human (scholar) and technology, we can use this as an analytical framework to question the role of existing and emerging technological infrastructures such as the Internet of Things as they relate to human agency, the politics of labour, and the production of knowledge.

minimal consumption
- what technologies do we/should we use? Minimal computing involves taking a critical look at the labour and production practices involved in the creation of computing technologies, such as planned obsolescence and the continuing refinement of consumer electronics. Who is the consumer and what power are they given or denied? Where is the worker in all this?
- "reduced consumption is frequently associated with creativity, craft, experimentation, or serious leisure"
- how does the ever-present demand for progress influence our perception and use of time. "What are we given time to do? What is expected of that time?"
- "How might minimal computing increase our shared capacities to think or imagine, and not just our individual capacities to work or produce?"
- "prototyping becomes experimental inquiry" creation as a form of research, not consumer production
"it's not about asceticism or withdrawal. It's about intervening in norms via heterogenous time."

##minimal maintenance
- the Long Now. Where will our computing projects be in 20 years? 200 years? 2000 years? 2 million years?
- updates, flexible software, file formats, change histories
- "Who do we expect to keep these machines running, and for how long?"
- what if we take the opposite view? What do we learn from ephemeral technologies?
- two sides: long term control over the means of production including design and maintenanc; short term experimentation and allowing projects to die and fade when their mission is accomplished.

##minimal barriers
- open access, open source, open knowledge? How much expertise is assumed by these projects? "people still need to know how to participate in production"
- "design performed according to accessability guidelines increases the robustness and overall quality of projects."
- minimal = local, specific to one's environment, what can be cheaply and easily obtained

##minimal internet
- "perhaps minimal computing is computing off the internet"
- trend vs. reality. Choice vs. necessity. Cross-economic communication vs. appropriation. "How do we practice minimalization without romanticizing life before or without the web?"

##minimal externals
- Do It Yourself / Do It Ourselves i.e. self-publishing
- "Practicioners may steward their own data, publish their own content, write their own scripts, build their own hardware, or avoid proprietary technologies."
- focus on how control is articulated. As reaction against oppression/silencing? As manifestation of the individual's vision?
- "how stages of production... mediate social relations and agency" Who does what and why?

##minimal automation
- we need to understand what our algorithms are doing and why, they are not a magical black box whose processes may go unquestioned.
- instrument vs. machine. The former guides knowledge production, the latter objectifies and alienates it. If we cannot trust our algorithms, it is better not to use them at all.
- focus is on human engagement in decision-making

##minimal space
- as computers reduce in size, how does this affect our theoretical understanding of space? Where do we do our computing work? Is it necessary to have a lab or studio?
- the de-localization of work via smartphone, email
- the role of physical space in organizing community. What happens when this is taken away?

##minimal technical language
- what do we gain or lose through jargon? Technical specificity is important, but it contravenes or problematizes open access.
- "Maybe, then, minimal computing could become a space for building a common language about shared concerns across technology and culture."
- a diverse approach that questions technology through a multitude of perspectives in order to arrive at common ground

##minimal ___
- it's up to us! We can find new ways to be minimal
