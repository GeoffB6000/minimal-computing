Alex Gil - "The User, the Learner and the Machines We Make"

http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/

- minimal hardware vs. minimal learning curve/minimal effort. What minimals are important to us?

- "minimal computing is in the eye of the beholder"

- "what do we need?" & "architectures of necessity"
Architectures of Necessity: http://architectureofnecessity.com/

- What do we need in the humanities? "the renewal, dissemination, and preservation of the scholarly record", "the pressing work of scholarly critique of the present"

- the record is an analog/digital hybrid in constant negotiation

- we won't always have help producing digital scholarship... what can we do on our own? "what do we need?"

- proprietary software puts distance between scholars and the texts they produce and attempt to make public

- the haptic fallacy: we can't touch computer programs, so we have a tendency not to see them as real.

- minimal computing is about reinforcing the connection between the author and their work in the context of digital knowledge production. You have to be critical of the tools you use, where they come from, what's going on behind the screen...

"minimal computing reconciles minimal knowledge with the production of a minimal artifact, without creating necessary friction for the readers."

"Another consequence of reconnecting with our knowledge production is an increased awareness of the cost of scholarly and human memory on the molecular arrangement of the planet." - there is an ecological cost to digital storage in electricity used, in connection with our methods of generating power. There is therefore an ethical imperative/drive towards sustainable energy.
