minimal computing

Plan
- historical perspective: how did minimal computing arise out of regular computing? In the beginning, all computing was minimal computing.
- current practices: what solutions are available for minimal computing? What projects are underway? Interesting things to look at + unexpected uses
- political/theoretical implications: why is minimal computing necessary?
