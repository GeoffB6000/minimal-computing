- tension between accessibility and visibility

- wearable technology is frequently designed according to minimalist aesthetics which intend to make the product unobtrusive or invisible. This is at odds with the cultural connotations of dress as outlined in Garments of Paradise by Susan Elizabeth Ryan. All dress relays some form of statement about the wearer - it is a form of communication. What does the marketing of wearable technologies as subtle, minimal, invisible say about the designer, the consumer, the wearer, and the biopolitics of wearable technologies?

- The Arduino Lilypad opposes this tendency by foregrounding its visibility. Its designer Leah Buechley intended the "soft, colourful, beautiful aesthetic" of the device to "affect the world of engineering applications." What possibilities are opened up in the world of engineering by a commitment to this aesthetic?

- Projects using the Lilypad incorporate its visual features as part of their designs, including the controller and circuitry. In this sense, the aesthetic beauty of the complete project emphasizes its inner functions as a piece of wearable technology. "The visible stitches of a Lilypad circuit make transparent the workings of circuits"
- This is opposed to the minimalist design aesthetic.

- "Fashioning Circuits, a public humanities program that explores the ways in which fashion and emerging media intersect and that works with community partners to introduce beginners to making and coding through wearable media."
- This project has never received grant funding (minimal funding)
- "By keeping our financial requirements low, we retain control and we retain flexibility."
- This project has no administrative infrastructure (minimal administration). Knight manages the entire project and recruits volunteers for events. DIY mentality.
- Maximal time investment (the things we trade off for going minimal?)
- "It is not minimal because it generates tremendous goodwill."
- "It is not minimal because we have space."
- Should we keep a checklist for every project to see whether it is "minimal enough?"
"Does this mean we are no longer minimal? I guess the question to ask is why does this matter?"

- Going minimal opens up possiblilities that would otherwise be locked. "The minimalism of the project's financial and administrative needs made it less likely that anyone would tell me no."
- minimalism as choice vs. minimalism as necessity
